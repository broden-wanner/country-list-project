# Country List Project

This project is an application that receives a three-letter code for a North American Country and returns a list of 
all countries a driver must travel through to go from the United State of America to the destination. We 
use a simplified map of North America:
- CAN - Canada borders the United States
- USA - The United States borders Canada and Mexico
- MEX - Mexico borders the United States, Guatemala, and Belize
- BLZ - Belize borders Mexico and Guatemala
- GTM - Guatemala borders Mexico, Belize, El Salvador, and Honduras
- SLV - El Salvador borders Guatemala and Honduras
- HND - Honduras borders Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua
- NIC - Nicaragua borders Honduras and Costa Rica
- CRI - Costa Rica borders Nicaragua and Panama 
- PAN - Panama borders Costa Rica
